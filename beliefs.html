        <h1>Our Beliefs</h1>
        <h2>AFFIRMATION OF FAITH</h2>
        <h2>We believe in the Father who is God Almighty.<br><br>

The Creator of all things and the Preserver of Light 
and life.<br><br>

We believe in the son, who is Jesus Christ, God’s 
only begotten son.<br><br>

He was human and divine, truly lived, suffered and 
died, rose again from the dead, ascended on high, 
and is coming again.<br><br>

We believe that Jesus was sent by God to reveal 
God to man.<br><br>

That whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish 
but have everlasting life.<br><br> 

We believe in the Holy Ghost who was sent from 
God the Father and the Son.<br><br>

That the Holy Spirit convicts and converts sinners, 
dwells in the believer, keeps the believer from the 
power of sin, and leads him to the Father through 
His Son, Jesus Christ.<br><br>

We believe that the Bible is the Word of God given 
by inspiration through Holy Men.<br><br>

That in the Bible, God seeks to reveal His Will to 
man and man seeks to respond to God’s revelation.<br><br>

We believe that the union of the Father, Son, and 
Holy Ghost is revealed through His Church.<br><br>

That all believers are united into one body, the 
Church.<br><br>

We believe that Christ is coming back for His 
Church without spot or wrinkle.<br><br> 

That without Holiness in spirit, soul, and body, no 
man shall see the Lord.</h2></body>
